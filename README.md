02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

Your Task
Welcome to this week's Challenge! Create a web application from scratch! This week, you'll build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresss.

User Story
A portfolio of my work is used tp showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.

Dev Notes 
The image sizing is very difficult because i had a hard time either taking screeshots of the web application or the width and height is very different from eachother so when i went to correct it the rec finder image is very blurry in the intial process.
